<b><i>I would love to visit </i></b>
<dt><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mount Apo in Digos, Davao Del Sur which is in the Southern part of Mindanao. Being a Davaoeno I am very grateful by knowing that the volcano that got the perfect cone shape and the massive volcano in the Philippines is located near our city, Davao City. Based from my Mother they always tell us that Mount Apo is the one who protects us from natural forces destruction like Typhoons, Hurricanes which could erase a city and.or town. They said that the Mount Apo is the who safeguards the citizens behind it so that people who lives their cannot be hurt. Mount Apo is in Digos City, which is 1hour and 30mins from Davao City if I would to take a bus ride. I wish I could go and visit Mount Apo someday.</p>
