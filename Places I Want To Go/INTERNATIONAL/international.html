<b><i>I would love to visit </i></b>
<dt><p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. Located in the western part of Europe. Way back highschool when my friends and I talked about travelling overseas we thought how about our very first destination? And I though to myself that Paris, France would be my first. I just get so amused about it`s structure, got fascinated on it`s engineering and the architecture itself. Though it is the highest infrastructure in Paris, I just knew something that triggers me deep within and that is the Paris` catacombs. I would love to go down the passage railways and get explored.</p>
